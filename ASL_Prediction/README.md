# Improving Accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Through Computer Vision Technologies
Imagine losing your ability to hear and having to rely solely on hand gestures to communicate. Everyday interactions, such as ordering food, seeking medical assistance, or handling financial matters, could become challenging. The deaf and hard of hearing communities often face such hurdles, leading to social isolation and limited access to essential services. Despite the availability of sign language, the lack of qualified interpreters exacerbates these difficulties.

To address this issue, a potential solution lies in leveraging computer vision technology to interpret American Sign Language (ASL).
